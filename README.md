# Restaurant Page

The goal of this project is practicing DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a simple restaurant homepage.
Major task is to use JavasScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website.

For this project I decided to use MVC and Publisher-subscriber patterns for the architecture.

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

Live preview of the [restaurant page](https://mojotron.github.io/restaurant-page/) project, via Github Pages.

## What have I learned

- connecting Webpack and Font Awesome
- implementing basic cart for ordering food
- implement basic form inputs validation using the synergy of inputs and labels.
- creating independent page sections and using them as templates/layers for rendering pages.
- using small size images for better load performance (I used [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/) resizing images, easy, fast and powerful tool for the job).

As inspiration I used [Michi Ramen](https://michiramen.com/) website. For a bonus challenge, I made parts without inspecting the page with the developer tools.
