# Restaurant Page

Goal of this project is
practicing DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering simple restaurant homepage.
Major task is to use JavasScript alone to generate the entire contents of the
website.

For this project i decided to use MVC and Publisher-subscriber patterns for the architecture.

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

Live preview of the [restaurant page]() project, via Github Pages .

## What have I learned

- connecting Webpack and Font Awesome
- implementing basic cart for ordering food
- implement basic form inputs validation using synergy of inputs and labels.
- creating independent page sections and using them as templates for rendering pages.

As inspiration I used [Michi Ramen](https://michiramen.com/) website. For the bonus challenge I made parts without inspecting page with developer tools.
